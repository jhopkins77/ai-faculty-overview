						<h4>This is "Note G", written by Ada Lovelace in 1842.</h4>
						<hr>
						<p>Lovelace was translating a lecture on Charles Babbage's "Analytical Engine," a proposed device for complex math and logic problems </p>
						<img class="r-stretch" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cc/Babbages_Analytical_Engine%2C_1834-1871._%289660574685%29.jpg">
						<p>Here's a piece of the engine, which was never finished.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>The engine was sometimes referred to as...</h4>
						<hr>
						<p><strong>A Computer!</strong></p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>Note G is most famous for two reasons.</h4>
						<hr>
						<p>First, Lovelace proposed how the engine could be used to solve problems through a regimented series of steps, e.g. an algorithm. </p>
						<img class="r-stretch" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cc/Babbages_Analytical_Engine%2C_1834-1871._%289660574685%29.jpg">
						<p>This picture? It shows the algorithm. I don't get it either.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>The second reason is more important for us here. Here's the key quote</p>
						<blockquote class="r-fit-text">Again, it might act upon other things besides number, were objects found whose mutual fundamental relations could be expressed by those of the abstract science of operations, and which should be also susceptible of adaptations to the action of the operating notation and mechanism of the engine. Supposing, for instance, that the fundamental relations of pitched sounds in the science of harmony and of musical composition were susceptible of such expression and adaptations, the engine might compose elaborate and scientific pieces of music of any degree of complexity or extent.</blockquote>
						<p><strong>Why is this important?</strong></p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>A computer can represent anything IF that thing can be described, on some level, as numbers.</p>

						</p><strong>AI is an extension of normal computer: taking the world, making it into numbers, and reflecting those numbers back out to users</strong></p>

						</p><strong>Translation: AI is not magic, and be skeptical of people who descibe it as such (even if some components of it ARE mysterious).</strong></p>

						<p><i>Standard disclaimer: I am not a comptuer scientist. If you are and something here is absurdly wrong, please reach out.</i></p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>Generative AI systems are built on top of neural nets. Neural nets are series of computer processors that are linked together in parallel lazers</h4>
						<img alt="diagram of a neural net">
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>The neurons in your brain fire in certain patterns to build associations between physical sensations ("wall of hot orange gas") and mental concepts ("fire"). Neural nets mimic that process, both for simple processes:</h4>
						<img alt="picture of 1+1 = 2">

						<h4>And more complex ones:</h4>

						<h4>Examples of simple neural nets</h4>
							<ul>
								<li>Calculating the correlation between two large data sets</li>

							<p class="fragment fade-out">Large Language Models use <strong>HUGE</strong> numbers of CPU's to take the relationship between words and concepts in the English language and turn them into numbers</p>
							<p class="fragment current-visible">Those numbers come from anylyzing pretty much all the languge that's publicly availble (e.g., Internet posts)</p>

					</section>
					<section>
						<p>Widely-used LLM's (e.g., ChatGPT) all operate on this principal. There are still differences between models:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>How much data do they have access to?</li>
							<li>The number of CPUs they have available (more CPU's = more complex neural nets that can do more things)</li>
							<li>How much "fine-tuning" (tweaking of weights based on new data and situation-specific commands) they've done</li>
						</ul>
					</section>

						<h3><strong>Ultimately though, neural nets remain the foundational concept of all LLM's.</strong></h3>

						<p>This is true even when you're dealing with personal content, aka "Retreval-augmented generation" (RAG)</p>

						<h2>Ethical Questions</h2>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>1. Hallucination & Bias</h3>
						<div class="r-stack">
							<p class="fragment fade-in-then-out">As we've discussed, AI is always looking to produce the most likely answer to a response.</p>
							<p class="fragment fade-in-then-out">This means it's not always considering whether words are reflecting accurate or impartial information</p>
							<p class="fragment fade-in-then-out">As is a result, it can sometimes insert innacurrate or biased info (e.g., inserting sources that don't actually exist)</p>
						</div>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>2. Copyright</h3>
						<div class="r-stack">
							<p class="fragment fade-in-then-out">There is a live debate on whether AI systems have violated copright in training their models on Internet data.</p>
							<p class="fragment fade-in-then-out">Companies like OpenAI have been sued by content producers, who say they should be compensated for their intellectual property being incorproated into LLM's.</p>	
							<p class="fragment fade-in-then-out">If all this makes you feel generally uncomfortable or if particular AI content feels too close to human-generated works, it may be worht avoiding AI.</p>
						</div>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>3. Environmental Issues</h3>
						<div class="r-stack">
							<p class="fragment fade-in-then-out">AI systems rely on large data centes that use huge amounts of power. This is already having an impact on local power grids</p>
							<img class="fragment fade-in-then-out" alt="screenshot on energy prices">
							<p class="fragment fade-in-then-out">While individal AI prompts are not energy intensive, large sums or prompts are.</p>

						<h2>How to incorporate this into your teaching?</h2>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>There are two big places where you need to think about AI and how it impacts your work</p>
							<ul>
								<li>The curricular materials you produce</li>
								<li>The materials you ask students to produce</li>
							</ul>
						<p><strong>Let's look at that first item</strong></p>
					</section>
				</section>
				<section>
					<section>
						<p>Think back to the types of tasks AI is good at:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Things that are generic</li>
								<li>Things with rigid conventions</li>
								<li>Things that just need to "good enough"</li>
								<li>Things for which there is already a lot of writing</li>
								<li>Things for which there are clear answers</li>
								<li>Things that are lower stakes</li>
							</ul>
						<p>What things in your teaching meet these criteria?</p>
					</section>

						<p>There are several places where it is appopriate for you to use AI</p>

								<li>Syllabus planning</li>
								<li>Lesson planning</li>

								<li>Locating sources</li>
								<li>Summarizing your own work</li>

						<p>There are also situation where AI could be appropriate, but it's debatable</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Grading</li>
								<li>Personalized feedback</li>
								<li>Communication with students</li>
								<li>Summarizing others' work</li>
